Nibi Inc. is the startup I pour most of time into. And Nibiru is the product we
bring to life. I created this page to give both of them a proper introduction.

## Nibi Inc.

Nibi Inc. is a private, for-profit company that focuses on building and
developing Nibiru, a blockchain designed for performance-intensive Web3
applications.

The company was founded in 2022. It's based in Texas, and I'm the CEO.

Nibi Inc. designs, writes, and maintains software related to everything from
user interfaces and tools to smart contracts and core blockchain logic for
Nibiru. Most of this is technology is [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru).

At Nibi Inc., we work closely with the Nibiru Foundation—made up of the Matrix
Foundation and MTRX Services, Ltd.—to drive the growth and sustainability of the
Nibiru ecosystem. Together, we aim to advance decentralized technology and its
adoption.

Though each organization contributing to Nibiru shares a common goal of growing
and expanding the Nibiru ecosystem, they operate indendently within their
respective roles. Nibi Inc. focuses on technological development and innovation,
while Nibiru Foundation concentrates on growing and fostering community and
supporting the teams building apps on top of Nibiru.

## About Nibiru

Nibiru is a blockchain engineered to make building and using Web3 applications
faster, more efficient, and more accessible. Nibiru moves digital assets and data
quickly and securely, enabling developers to create innovative solutions without
the usual limitations in blockchain scaling.

Backed by $20.5 million from top investors in East Asia and the United States,
we're opening the door to new decentralized financial (DeFi) products and
user-friendly experiences.

Nibiru is a **high-performance blockchain** that implements a novel, **Multi VM (virtual machine) architecture**, which includes an
**EVM-equivalent** execution engine called Nibiru EVM. This opens Nibiru up to a wide
design space of useful applications for consumers and institutions.

1. **Builders on Nibiru can launch faster**: Developers can pick familiar tools,
   avoid costly rewrites, and deploy new services in hours instead of weeks.
2. **Built for speed**: Nibiru **executes state updates in parallel**,
   meaning multiple tasks run concurrently, so the network stays performant even under
   heavy load.
3. **EVM Bytecode Compatibility**: Nibiru runs the same smart contract code that
   Ethereum uses.
4. **Flexible Runtimes**: Our design lets you mix language and frameworks without
   the overhead of using cross-chain messaging or Layer 2 solutions.
