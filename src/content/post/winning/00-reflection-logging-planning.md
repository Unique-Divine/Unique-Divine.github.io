Originally written Sep 26, 2020. Last Updated Jan 8, 2025.

My athletic journey across American football, martial arts, powerlifting, and
track and field, spanned over a decade and exposed me to a multitude of strength
and conditioning programs, diets, and exercise regimens.

There was a point in time where I was doing a more intense phase of
bodybuilding from the tail end of high school leading into my first few years
of college.

Whether in bulking to put on muscle mass or in phases of cutting, the key that
accelerated my progress more than anything was to log and take
record of everything, almost obsessively so. I picked this up about 6 years ago
(~2015) from Brandon Carter, a popular entrepreneur in the fitness industry.

The idea was simple: In order to gain actionable knowledge on **which factors
account most for your progress or lack thereof** in the gym, **log
everything**.

- Track daily water consumption down to the milligram.
- Take note of the food you put into your body and how much time you've spent
  sleeping each night.
- Track the sets, reps, and exercises done in your workouts.
- Maybe add a note about how you were feeling and when your energy levels were
  best.
- Measure your biceps, calves, thighs, waist, neck, forearms, etc. and record
  your bodyweight at least once per week.

It sounds extreme if it's the first time you've heard about a strategy like
this. I assure you, this technique works. By taking a meticulous record of all
of the factors that impact your goals, you're better able to assess what needs
to be changed to get your desired outcome. You know when to add and take away
calories, if your hydration is off, whether or not you're stretching enough to
prevent injuries, if certain foods are strongly affecting your energy levels.

I tried this approach for a few months and found huge success when I was
bulking up from weighing 185 to 205 lbs. I added 80 lbs to my 1 rep squat max
and 35 to my bench because of consistency and tweaks I knew to make from
keeping a training log.

## Planning vs. Reflection

I believe that one of the main reasons this approach is effective is that it
takes the emphasis off of planning and places it on reflection. A lot of
programs and methods for being more productive in school, work, fitness, and
entrepreneurship place too much of an emphasis on planning. People get caught
up in "analysis paralysis" and struggle to take the key actions that are going
to drive success.

And this is natural. It feels good to write up some awesome plan on how you're
going to lose weight or learn a new skill, detailing different exercises you'll
do and how you'll stick to some strict regimine. But when it comes to actually
acting out these plans, we often realize that we were too ambitious with the
initial plan of attack.

Letting ourselves miss a few reps turns into missing a day, and then a few
days, and then a week, and before we know it, we're quitting the program
altogether (I'm looking at you, New Year's resolutions).

Don't get me wrong, planning before jumping into large projects is still
valuable. I've found that a short phase of metalearning before a large
undertaking gives me the best results in both the short and long term. The main
problem with planning at the beginning of a long personal development journey
is that we have the least amount of knowledge and experience at the beginning
of the journey where we are most likely to undergo a "planning phase". This
means that the initial plan we develop at the start of a goal is made when we
are most naive. That's problematic because:

**Plans and schedules only tell us about the life we'd _like_ to have. Logs
tell us about the life we're living**.

Shifting over to reflective thinking can be painful because it involves looking
only at the reality of what happened. It leaves no room for delusions and talk,
just action.

Let's fast forward a few years to Janurary of 2020. This was the beginning of
my last semester of undergrad at Columbia University and my primary goals
changed a lot from what they were in high school. I'd set my sights on working
with code, learning as much as I could about data science and artificial
intelligence, and getting a job in that domain.

The natural thing to do was set out a battle plan for how I'd spend the
semester and set a list of objectives for the next 4-6 months (I'll talk more
about drafting up plans in a future post). And, I decided to bring back the
"training log" strategy, except this time, I'd be using the log to track my
time spent doing [deep work](https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/) rather than
time spent bodybuilding.

[Deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) is a concept I heard
about from Cal Newport, a famous author and computer science professor at
Georgetown University. He describes deep work as

> "Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration
> that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create
> new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate."

According to this definition, shallow work mst refer to things like bouncing
between email inboxes, wasting time in meetings you don't really need to
attend, and glancing at text or social media notifications. Cal Newport
describes shallow work as

> "Non-cognitively demanding, logical-style tasks, often performed while
> distracted. These efforts tend to not create new value in the world and are
> easy to replicate."

Since my new deep work training log didn't account for shallow work, I could
not count time spent in lecture, time spent in office hours, time spent
"studying" near friends (where I'd end up socializing probably 40-100% of the
time), or time spent doing any other passive form of learning/practice. I
noticed that by taking a record of only deep work, filling up the log became a
sort of game I'd play, where I'd try to accrue as much time spent doing deep
work as possible. Here's the log for the first few weeks of class that
semester:

</figure>

Toward the beginning of the year, I broke up the categories based on my
coursework and short-term goals. In the above picture, the rows are the
categories and the columns are for each day of the week. I had a category for
each course I was taking in addition to one for active Japanese studies
(日本語), one for programming (古い/CS), and one for exercise (運動). There's
an aggregate total number of hours along the bottom for each day (blue) and
along the right side for each category (yellow).

## How to use the log

Keeping this log helped me gain a sense of which areas were being and which
ones needed improvement. I'd go back at the end of a week to highlight these
areas and then iteratively used my own past data to inform future
decision-making.

It's healthiest to think of the log as a brutally honest tool for a
diagonistic. Procrastination and failures of _effort_ are diseases. In my
psychological space, **we don't fail when something goes wrong. We fail when
our effort is not at the level it needs to be.**

**Never worry or beat yourself up about things that are not in your control.
Look at yourself as an imperfect being that needs work, but at the same time,
love yourself.**

I realize that a lot of this is easier said than done. The log's purpose is not
to shame you for being imperfect. There's no such thing as _being_ perfect.
Instead, it's healthier to think in terms of giving a perfect effort.

Logging is simply going to help you have a clear understanding of what went
wrong, why things went wrong, and how you need to change your thinking in order
to accelerate progress and fix and/or prevent problems in the future.

I'd constantly ask myself the following questions while reviewing my activity
log:

- How can I spend the same or less time to accomplish better results?
- Am I really commiting to diligent focus during deep work sessions? And if
  not, how can I further develop my focusing skills?
- Did I spend the most time on the tasks that generate the most value?
- What activities can I cut out that are not helping me grow, not pushing me
  toward my goals, or not making me happy?
- Which activites most raise my [human capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humancapital.asp#:~:text=Human%20capital%20is%20an%20intangible,such%20as%20loyalty%20and%20punctuality.),
  make me feel fulfilled, and add value to other people's lives?

Throughout the semester of tracking in this manner, I noticed over time that I
could **accomplish more in less time**. And, I could stand to spend more time
doing so. Both efficiency and endurance improved.

I also noticed that 9 times out of 9, whenever I had too many things on my
plate in a given week, it was preceded by obvious negligence in a particular
area. For instance, if I had to pull an all-nighter to spend 18 hours
perfecting a coding assignment or a lab report, the log would show that I
neglected working on anything related to that class for as long as a full week
(or more).

I could see concrete evidence to support that I was often my own worst enemy
through the many creative ways I'd end up shooting myself in the foot.

So, I stopped.

## A concrete example: What changed for me?

Let's fast forward a few months up to the present day (currently the end of September 2020)...

You may have noiced that the categories on the left are much different. That's
because my priorities changed quite drastically since the onset of the year. A
lot of this had to do with the bulleted questions above and changes I made
after reflecting.

### Major Change 1: Logging Shallow Work

I added in a "supplementary" category (追加の) to track inevitable shallow work
tasks such as running errands for family members, paying bills, responding to
important emails, doing taxes, filling out forms, etc. This curbed feelings of
guilt associated with tasks that weren't directly related to my craft yet still
had significant impact. It didn't make sense that I'd feel bad about taking
care of "regular life stuff", so I found a compromise: **Shallow tasks could
still be logged as long as I gave them absolute focus and a respectable
effort**.

### Major Change 2: Viewing the Activity Log as the Measurement of a Quantum State

This isn't as complicated as it sounds. In quantum theory, predictions made are
generally stochastic, or probabilistic. Often, the probability of obtaining
certain observable outcomes is described instead of a prediction using definite
values. Here's a non-quantum, concrete example about this concept:

> If you’ve ever listened to a bus or train announcement you know that it’s possible to get more than none, but far less than all, of the information you’d like. For example; after an announcement you may decide that there’s a 70% chance the train is late, a 25% chance it’s on time, and a 5% chance that someone with a crippling speech defect has violently taken over the PA system. This is a partial measurement, because a full measurement would take the form of 100% probabilities. As in; “the train is definitely, 100%, late”. - [askamathematicician.com](https://www.askamathematician.com/2011/06/q-what-is-a-measurement-in-quantum-mechanics/)

Advice from other people, while useful, only tells us uncertain, probabilistic
information. It is only when we try things out for ourselves that our
information becomes deterministic, i.e. 100% certain [[1](#footnotes)].

I'm not suggesting that you ignore advice and carry excessive skepticism
against the recommendations of others. I'm simply suggesting that you look more
at how your "measurements" inform your future because The future is uncertain,
while your measurements (past experiences) are not.

I applied this ideology when I decided to stop forcing myself to do things that
people theorized would be good for me and looked more at my experimental data
and the conclusions I found from working on projects first-hand.

- **No more close readings of textbook on the first pass**: I, like many others
  have been told to read things closely and take notes which can later be
  reviewed. This is great advice for retention in absence of potential time
  constraints.
- **No more taking courses on topics that don't excite me**: Any course that
  contains material I couldn't see a direct application for
- **No more sleeping at conventional times just because other people do so**: I
  sleep whenever I'm tired and I have my work done. If I'm ahead of schedule
  and feel like binge-watching psychological thriller anime at 3am, I do so.
- **No more theoretical foundations in statistics**: Beginner data scientists
  are often taught to learn calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, some
  foundational programming, and of course, the theoretical underpinnings of
  statistics. Because of my background in physics, I only needed to focus on
  programming and statistics. I have not yet found much utility from learning
  STAT 4001, the introductory graduate statistics course at Columbia
  University. It was only when I found a problem that warranted the usage of
  techniques such as hypothesis testing and comparing categorical variables
  with chi-squared coefficients that I began to appreciate the tools I
  previously learned about. And none of that mattered unless I could implement
  everything in code. As a beginner, data science ended up being 95%
  programming in my experience, which was not in line with the narrative I'd
  often been told.
- **No more physics**: Sorry, Physics. Your time has come and gone. We had fun.
  I like building and creating stuff too much to study fundamental, physical
  truths of reality. Coding feels more like music and art to me.

Basically, just **try to cut out work that you know you're not interested in**.
That worked for me, but I had to be patient and wait until that was something I
could do without jeopardizing my future. Please don't quit your day job or drop
out of school to become a SoundCloud rapper because of this article (unless
that'd make you happy 😉).
