      <description>I like to dream as much as anyone. However, I&amp;rsquo;m also a huge fan of results and tangible evidence.
I was an athlete for probably 10 years of my life and so I&amp;rsquo;d tried a multitude of different strength and conditioning programs, diets, and exercise methods. There was a point in time where I was doing a more intense phase of bodybuilding from the tail end of high school leading into my first few years of college.</description>

An overall sense of burnout, frustration, confusion.
I’ve gotten well acquainted with the phrases,
“We reget to inform you at this time…”,
“Although we were impressed with your interview/qualifications…”,

I heard somebody say a few weeks back to “teach the thing you want to learn”.` It seemed a bit paradoxical the first time I thought about it.</description>
