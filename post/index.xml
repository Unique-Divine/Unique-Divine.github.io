      <description>[Amazon link] to support the author  Lately, something&amp;rsquo;s got me in a phase where I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in reading books about making art—like Art &amp;amp; Fear and Keep Going. I believe I first heard about Kleon&amp;rsquo;s writing from Ali Abdaal.
Keep Going sticks to Kleon&amp;rsquo;s classic, pocket-sized, lighthearted but heavy-hitting style. It&amp;rsquo;s a quick read, so I went through it a few times. With books like this, I like to make one pass through to jot down quotes and notes on passages that resonate with me and then wrestle with the ideas for a while before coming back to the text.</description>

      <description>A quick note on scheduling. To-do lists and schedules are great tools with obvious utility. They help us keep our lives from becoming too chaotic and make it easier to &amp;ldquo;steer the ship&amp;rdquo; toward long-term goals. As someone who used to struggle with organization, I benefit a lot from utilizing strucured strategies such as the Getting Things Done (GTD) system and from convenient tools like schedules and Todoist. Inspite of this, I often find myself unable to keep up with the some of the schedules and daily goals I set for myself.</description>

      <description>I like to dream as much as anyone. However, I&amp;rsquo;m also a huge fan of results and tangible evidence.
I was an athlete for probably 10 years of my life and so I&amp;rsquo;d tried a multitude of different strength and conditioning programs, diets, and exercise methods. There was a point in time where I was doing a more intense phase of bodybuilding from the tail end of high school leading into my first few years of college.</description>

      <description>I recently crossed the 10,000 sentence mark in my dearly beloved spaced repitition software (SRS), Anki, after noticing that my deck includes 10,317 mature sentence cards.
At the onset of my learning journey, I was excited and inspired by Khatzumoto&amp;rsquo;s progress and figured I could learn a thing or two by temporarily giving in to dogma.
This milestone took me roughly two years of consistent grinding, where I averaged between 60-200 minutes of daily study time depending on the month and my availability.</description>
