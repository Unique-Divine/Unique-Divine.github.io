## A quick note on scheduling.
 
To-do lists and schedules are great tools with obvious utility. They help us
keep our lives from becoming too chaotic and make it easier to "steer the ship"
toward long-term goals. As someone who used to struggle with organization, I
benefit a lot from utilizing strucured strategies such as the [Getting Things
Done (GTD) system][gtd-summary] and from convenient tools like schedules and
[Todoist][todoist-yt]. In spite of this,  I often find myself unable to keep up
with the some of the schedules and daily goals I set for myself. 

This isn't so much because of an ability to actually do the work as it is an
unwillingness to do it. Following *exact* plans for how to divvy up my time
each day is just so unappealing. I find that I'm able to accomplish a much more
when I let myself indulge in exploration and productive play. This raises a
question, "how can one make exploration and play more common and systematic in
daily life?" 

## What's wrong with this task list? 

Over the past few weeks, I've had around 10 hours of recurring tasks that I aim
to spend time on each day. These tasks are divided up between paid work,
research positons, classes I'm involved in, exercise, and personal learning
objectives. I add these tasks to a recurring checklist in Todoist that looks
like this: 

[gtd-summary]: https://sive.rs/book/GettingThingsDone
[gtd-ted-talk]: https://youtu.be/CHxhjDPKfbY
[todoist-yt]: https://youtu.be/rM8RmmKR8gs

| Hours | Task |
| :--: | :-- |
| 3 | Job | 
| 2 | Research |
| 3 | Coursework for grad school |
| 2 | Personal projects, Anki, Writing, Music practice |

This seemed reasonable when I first made it. It's a college schedule for
seven-day workweeks consisting of daily goals based on the input time rather
than the output of results. 

The problem is that this task list reflects *minimum* requirements for me to be
able keep up with everything. Clocking in 11 hours a day 7 days a week is
difficult to keep up with. I'm either too determined or too stubborn to renege
on commitments. Unfortunately, this means that unexpected errands and
miscalculations on how long things will take can derail my schedule, inevitably
resulting in missed sleep and general... unhappiness. 

Even if I stayed diligent about putting in time on my goals, I'd regularly fail
to reach these benchmarks after a while. The quantity of work would be there,
but the balance would be off. For example, I might spend 6 hours on one course
and no time on my research. Sometimes, I'd do 12+ hours of research in one area
and then go to dinner or watch Netflix with my girlfriend. And there's nothing
wrong with that; that day sounds like an absolute win. However, when reviewing
my task list at the end of such a day, I'd see that I'm failing to reach many
of my daily goals‚Äîaccording to my checklist. 

Guilt builds up from constantly missing days and, before you know it, one
missed day turns into a few missed days. A few missed days turns into a few
missed weeks, and the whole system falls apart.

So, what's the fix? How can we make a checklist that urges healthy habit
formation without becoming too stressful to adhere to? Is this simply a
discipline problem? How can todo-lists be more flexible? I'm honestly surprised
I didn't think of this solution sooner. 

All I had to do was lower my minimum daily requirements. Simple as that. We
know this from world class athletes and musicians: **Consistency gives more
value over time than binge-purge cycles**. A good way to curb procrastination
is to give a small, consistent effort each day. There's no shame in embracing
and enjoying the low-hanging fruit. 

## A better, revised task list

| Hours | Task |
| :--: | :-- |
| 3 | Job | 
| 1 | Research |
| 1 | Coursework for grad school |
| 1 | Personal projects, Anki, Writing, Music practice |
| 4 | Flex |

"Flex" time is a catch-all task that accounts for both urgency and my
short-term preferences. **Flex is a placeholder for time spent working on any
of your top priorities**. If something unexpected comes up and I need to spend
a lot more time getting a deployment ready for work, it spills into flex. If
I'm reaching a flow state while learning about an engaging topic, I can go down
that rabbit hole too. The cool thing about flex is that it's strongly
recommended but ultimately optional. 

If you want to complete the minimum requirements of the non-flex tasks and then
spend the rest of the day watching anime, going to the beach, or spending time
with people that nourish you, flex time can give you the freedom to do so
without feeling like your actions and aspirations are misaligned. 

If your to-do objectives make you sad, stop setting them. It's easier to "walk
the talk" if you just make "the talk" shorter; you won't have to walk as far.
