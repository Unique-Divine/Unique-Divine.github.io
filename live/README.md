## Static Assets

Static assets used in cover images must be in the `.vuepress/public` directory. By convention, static assets are kept in `.vuepress/public/stat` for clarity.

Static assets used in articles should be somewhere easy to access with relative paths. By convention, most in-article static assets are kept in `[repo]/stat`.

## Post Front Matter

The `type` field can be set to the follwoing options.

- 'home': The landing page template.
- 'post': A blog post (article).
- 'page': A stand-alone page based on markdown.
- 'posts' A collection of articles.
  - 'tags': collection of articles based on tag
  - 'category': collection of articles based on category

These are specified by the `computed.content` field inside of the theme's `Layout.vue`.

## State Management

The vuepress theme uses `vuex` for state management. Inspired by Flux and Redux, Vuex is state management library for Vue applications that provides a centralized state management solution. 

The main concepts in Vuex are: 

1. **State**: State in Vuex is the single source of truth for all shared data within a Vue.js application. This means that any component within your application can access or mutate the state. 

2. **Getters**: Getters are similar to computed properties in Vue. They are used to compute derived state based on the store state. They can help to reduce code duplication, as you can use a getter once and reference it in multiple places.

3. **Mutations**: Mutations are synchronous transactions that are the only way to change state in a Vuex store. Each mutation has a string type and a handler. The handler function is where you perform actual state modifications, and it will receive the state as the first argument.

4. **Actions**: Actions are similar to mutations, with the difference being that actions can contain asynchronous operations. Actions commit mutations and can contain arbitrary asynchronous operations. 

5. **Modules**: Vuex allows us to divide our store into modules. Each module can contain its own state, mutations, actions, and even nested modules. This helps to keep the store organized as your application grows in complexity.

6. **Plugins**: Vuex supports plugins which allows developers to extend its functionality. They can be used for logging, persistence, handling async processes, etc.

Vuex is used to handle shared state among component. Not all state needs to be placed in Vuex. If a state is only relevant for a single component, it might be better to keep it local to that component.

It's important to note that Vuex, like Redux in the React ecosystem, adopts a unidirectional data flow. This means that data in the application follows the same lifecycle pattern, making the logic of state changes more predictable and understandable.
