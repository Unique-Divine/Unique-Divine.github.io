## I'm a programmer that makes music and writes.

I'm obsessed with learning, solving problems, and **creating**, whether this involves artwork, music, coding, whatever. To learn and create is my ikigai ([生き甲斐](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)).

## § — What I do for work

I'm a Co-Founder and one of the lead software engineers for a new DeFi hub called [Nibiru Chain](https://nibiru.fi). I'm also an open-source contributor in the broader Cosmos and Ethereum Ecosystems. 

## § — Noteworthy open-source code

## § — Other interests

- 🎼 Music: I try not to go a day without practicing 🎷 or 🎹.
- 🧠 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/): I'm a huge nerd about spaced repetition software and other strategies for accelerated learning. I've been using Anki to learn faster and remember more of what I learn for probably 5+ years at this point. Although I have over 100,000 mature cards, the reviews take up less than 10 minutes a day when I stop adding new material. Using Anki effectively was a crucial element in my journey to [learn Japanese to fluency](https://uniquedivine.blog/post/japanese/why_learn_jp_again/). 
- 📚 Reading: Some time in 2021, I decided to read and take notes on roughly two books a month. I mostly read biographies, self-help, and books on science and tech. Some of my recent favorites were:
  - About Face: The Odyssey of an American Warrior by Colonel David H. Hackworth
  - Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll
  - Machines Who Think by Pamela McCorduck
  - Diaries of Adam & Eve by Mark Twain
- 📊 Algorithmic trading
