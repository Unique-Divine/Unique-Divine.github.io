I made this page becuase I noticed the startup I put most of my time in

## Nibi, Inc.

Nibi, Inc. is a private, for-profit organization that focuses on building and
developing Nibiru, a blockchain designed for performance-intensive Web3
applications.

Nibi, Inc. was founded in 2022. The company's based in Texas and I'm the CEO.

Nibi, Inc. designs, writes, and maintains software related to user
interfaces, smart contracts, infrastructure, artifical intelligence models, developer
tools, and core logic related to Nibiru. Most of this is technology is
open-source and can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru).

At Nibi, Inc., we work closely with the Nibiru Foundation—made up of the Matrix
Foundation and MTRX Services, Ltd.—to drive the growth and sustainability of the
Nibiru ecosystem. Together, we aim to advance decentralized technology and its
adoption.

Though each organization contributing to Nibiru shares a common goal of growing
and expanding the Nibiru ecosystem, they operate indendently within their
respective roles. Nibi, Inc. focuses on technological development and innovation,
while Nibiru Foundation concentrates on community growth, business solutions, and
supporting the applications building on top of Nibiru.
