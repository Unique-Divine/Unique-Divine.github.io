I read a lot of advice.  
I watch it. I listen to it. Call it “self-help,” “life hacks,” or just “stuff people yell into microphones.” Whatever.  

If you’re anything like me, you’ve noticed a common theme in advice-givers.  
(And yes, I’m including myself here.)

It goes something like this:  
> **"What you’ve been doing SUCKS. You’re messing up. Do it THIS way!"**

And how does that make you feel?  
Like a schmuck, right? Like a fool scrambling to fix everything about yourself.  
So, you get busy. **Dutifully trying to shove your square self into whatever new round hole your advice-giver has prepared.**  

Let me stop you right there.

I’m not here to tell you what to do. The world already has plenty of that.  
Instead, let me tell you this:  

I don’t think the point of advice is to make you feel like crap.  
I don’t think the goal is to frantically rearrange your life to match someone else’s vision.  

Certainly, that’s not *my* intention.  
**Good advice should make your life easier, not harder.**  

### A Two-Step Process for Handling Advice

Here’s a simple method you might want to try:

1. Read or listen to the advice. Mine, theirs, whoever’s.  
2. Then do whatever the heck you want with it.  

Seriously. That’s it.

### The Forest, Not the Trees

Good advice is often more about exposure than execution.  
It’s about seeing the **forest**, not obsessing over the **trees**.  

Sometimes, following advice to the letter *is* the easiest, least painful way forward.  
**Imitation is how we learn.** If copying gets you where you need to go, then do it. No shame.  

But here’s the thing:  
You don’t have to fit yourself into the mold.  
**Take the mold and reshape it to fit you.**  

Don’t stress over minutiae. Minor deviations? Improvements? They’re normal. They’re desirable, even.  
When a cookie recipe tells you to sprinkle two nanograms of rosemary while singing the national anthem, feel free to skip that step.  

**Focus on the flour, sugar, and butter.** The core ingredients.  
Everything else is optional.  


### Relax. Seriously.

Of course, if it’s easier to just follow the advice exactly, do that.  
But chill. Relax. Don’t be a stressed-out zealot, frantically obeying every word as if your life depends on it. It doesn’t.  

And don’t spiral into despair, either.  
**“Maybe it’s possible for others, but not for me”** is the mantra of people who’ve already given up.  
Don’t be that person. Don’t be the emo “it’s all B.S.” person, either.  

Or…fine. Be that person. But be it **quietly**.  

### Protect Your Inner Child

Here’s the truth: **Adults are just kids with bank accounts and bigger bodies.**  
Our minds are just as fragile.  

We protect children from negativity, but what about ourselves?  
Why do we let our inner critic run rampant?  

Take a breath. Stop freaking out at yourself.  
Stop breaking yourself down. **Relax.**

The point of advice isn’t to become someone else. It’s to take what works and leave the rest.  
Take the feathers you need, and let the goose keep the rest.
