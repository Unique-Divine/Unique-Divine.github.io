## The Coding Commonplace

I've always liked the idea of a commonplace book. A living archive and system for
writing down and saving the most important points you learn in one common place.

With the following reference pages, I'm showing you the notes I find myself
coming back to again and again. These are not tutorials, nor are they geared
toward learning "about" a language or tool. Everything here is a concise resource
on how to *solve* a problem.

If you find something useful, please take it. If it sparks something, even better.

What is a commonplace? 

A commonplace book is a system for writing down and sorting all manner of
tidbits: quotes, anecdotes, observations, and information gleaned from books,
conversations, movies, song lyrics, social posts, podcasts, life experiences, or
anything else that you might want to return to later.

It's called a commonplace it's an aggregate, an all-encompassing system for
storing all of the the most important points you learn in one common place, a
central resource that makes it easy to find, re-read, and utilize each piece of
wisdom you have obtained.
