The collections API is a Golang package that improves upon state-related abstractions in the Cosmos-SDK. Here, we explain blockchain state and the advantages of NibiruChain/collections.

<!-- more -->

We recently implemented the collections API for better state management on Nibiru Chain and thought the tool would be useful for the broader Cosmos community. After integrating it to our core modules, we proposed an architectural design record (ADR) to the Cosmos-SDK, which got merged near the end of 2022. It was awesome to see such positive responses from core SDK contributors.
