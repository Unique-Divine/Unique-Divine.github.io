## I'm a programmer that makes music and writes.

I'm obsessed with learning, solving problems, and **creating**, whether this involves artwork, music, coding, anything. To learn and create is my ikigai ([生き甲斐](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)).

## What I do for work

I'm a Co-Founder and one of the lead software engineers for a Web3 project called [Nibiru](https://nibiru.fi). Formally, I'm the CEO of tech company called [Nibi, Inc.](/web3/nibiru/nibi-inc). I'm also an open-source contributor across several domains but tend to build mostly in the artificial intelligence and Web3 spaces.


## Other passions and interests

- **🧠 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)**: I'm a huge nerd about spaced
  repetition software and other strategies for accelerated learning. I've been
  using Anki to learn faster and remember more of what I learn for probably 5+
  years at this point. Although I have over 100,000 mature cards, the reviews
  take up less than 10 minutes a day when I stop adding new material. Using Anki
  effectively was a crucial element in my journey to [learn Japanese to
  fluency](https://uniquedivine.blog/post/japanese/why_learn_jp_again/).

- **🎼 Music**: I try not to go a day without practicing 🎷 or 🎹.

- **⚛️  Physics/Sciences** : AUp until 2020, almost all of my time went into
  developing competencies in physics, applied mathematics, and machine learning.
  I was almost certain I wanted to become a physicist but ended up more excited
  about other things. Although my professional trajectory has evolved a lot since
  then, I'm still fascinated by physics and mathematics, and I find myself going
down rabbit holes digging into new publications more than I'd like to admit.
Something abot exploring fundamental truths of reality and building an intution
about its principles to understand how things work pushes the right buttons for
me.

- **📚 Reading**: Some time in 2021, I decided to read and take notes on roughly
  two books a month. I mostly read biographies, self-help, and books on science
  and tech. Some of my recent favorites were:
  - About Face: The Odyssey of an American Warrior by Colonel David H. Hackworth
  - Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll
  - Machines Who Think by Pamela McCorduck
  - Diaries of Adam & Eve by Mark Twain

## Contact

The fastest way to get in contact with me is probably a direct message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeusExUnicus), but [e-mail](mailto:realuniquedivine@gmail.com) works too.

<!--
1. **Reorder for Narrative Flow**: Consider arranging your interests in a way
   that tells a story or shows a progression. For example, you could start with
   Anki, which represents your love for learning, then transition to music and
   reading, and finally to physics/sciences, demonstrating a journey from
   learning methods to application in various fields.

2. **Expand on Music and Reading**: Given the detailed descriptions in other
   sections, the music and reading sections could be expanded to include why you
   are drawn to these interests or what they bring to your life. This will
   maintain consistency in depth across all interests.

3. **Personal Anecdotes**: Where possible, include brief personal stories or
   experiences related to each interest. This approach adds a unique and engaging
   element to your profile.

4. **Reflective Tone**: Maintain a reflective and conversational tone throughout.
   This aligns with the overall personal theme of your website and makes your
   content more relatable to the reader.

5. **Consistent Formatting**: Ensure that the formatting (like bullet points,
   emojis, and links) is consistent throughout the section for a polished look.

6. **Concluding Statement**: Consider adding a brief concluding statement that
   ties all your interests together, reflecting how they shape your identity or
   influence your professional work.

By implementing these suggestions, you'll enhance the narrative quality and
personal touch of your "About" section, making it more engaging and reflective of
your personality.
