## I'm a programmer that makes music and writes.

I'm obsessed with learning, solving problems, and **creating**, whether this involves artwork, music, coding, anything. To learn and to create is my ikigai ([Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)).

## What I do for work

I'm a Co-Founder and one of the lead software engineers for a Web3 project called [Nibiru](https://nibiru.fi). Formally, I'm the CEO of tech company called [Nibi Inc.](/web3/nibiru/nibi-inc). I'm also an open-source contributor. I build mostly in the artificial intelligence and Web3 spaces.

## What I'm doing right now

In learning, there are times for exploration and times for exploitation. That is,
there are times to expand your knowledge base to get more source
material and times when you should make use of what knowledge is already there,
leverage the sharpened saw, and finish what is started.

I am in this second mode. Lots of programming. Lots of strategizing. No new books
or entertainment. Just growth and execution.

## Contact

The fastest way to get in contact with me is probably a direct message on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/DivineNibirun), but [e-mail](mailto:realuniquedivine@gmail.com) works too.

## Passions and interests

- **üß† [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)**: I'm a huge nerd about spaced
  repetition software and other strategies for accelerated learning. I've been
  using Anki to learn faster and remember more of what I learn for probably 5+
  years at this point. Although I have over 100,000 mature cards, the reviews
  take up less than 10 minutes a day when I stop adding new material. Using Anki
  effectively was a crucial element in my journey to [learn Japanese to
  fluency](/japanese/01-why-learn-japanese).

- **üéº Music**: I try not to go a day without practicing üé∑ or üéπ. Though this isn't
  always possible with things like travel, music forms an essential part of my life.

- **üî• Coding**: My [drug of choice](#my-drug-of-choice-coding).

- **Physics/Sciences** : Up until the age of 23, almost all of my time went into
  developing competencies in physics, applied mathematics, and machine learning.

  - I was almost certain I wanted to become a physicist as I went throught
    university but ended up more excited about other things. Although my
    professional trajectory has evolved a lot since then, I'm still fascinated
    by physics and mathematics, and I find myself going down rabbit holes and
    digging into new publications more than I'd like to admit.
  - Exploring what truths are fundamental to reality and building an intution
    about these principles pushes the right buttons for me.

- **üìö Reading**: Some time in 2021, I decided to read and take notes on roughly
  two books a month. I mostly read biographies, self-help, and books on science
  and tech. Some of my recent favorites were:

  - About Face: The Odyssey of an American Warrior by Colonel David H. Hackworth
  - Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll
  - Machines Who Think by Pamela McCorduck
  - Diaries of Adam & Eve by Mark Twain

  <!-- I coded for physics -->
  <!-- and AI research but never thought that coding would end up becoming the main -->
  <!-- thing I do with my time.  -->

## My drug of choice (coding)

In the later part of college, I was working on research in gravitational
lensing, this effect that's like **seeing the world through warped glass, except
the glass is gravity itself**.

Imagine that "empty" space isn't empty. It's more like soft, stretchy fabric. And
if we put something massive on it like a star or a galaxy, the fabric bends. All
things with mass are "massive". It's just that the bends are harder to notice
when mass is small.

Objects have to follow the paths created by these bends. And light doesn't get a
pass. Even though it's massless, it follows the curves of our gravitational
fabric. So when light from a distant object, say, a galaxy far, far away, passes
near something huge, its path bends.

We don't see the bend. We just see the result. Things look smeared, magnified,
even multiplied. A single galaxy might appear as arcs. A distant quasar might
echo around a foreground mass like it's glitching.

But there are no glitches in life. This lensing effect can be quantified,
estimated, and more well understood.

It turns out, you can estimate the physical parameters from observed
gravitational lensing with images of the distortions and deep neural networks. I
**chose to get better at coding** in order to work on this research.

And by some turn of events, I realized the tools I was using to complete my
research (AI predictive models) were more enthralling to me than the objectives
to which I was applying them. That was where I shifted more from a physicist or
mathematician to a technologist.

Coding aligns so closely with my natural inclinations. It has the perfect mixture
of engineering, problems to solve as puzzles, and applied creativity. It's like
playing with legos as a kid again, except you can build anything.

I've written well over a million lines of code at this point and have no
intention of stopping.

I've always believed that you have to go all in on something to find out if
you're really made for the craft or if you just like the sound of the end
results.

<!--
1. **Reorder for Narrative Flow**: Consider arranging your interests in a way
   that tells a story or shows a progression. For example, you could start with
   Anki, which represents your love for learning, then transition to music and
   reading, and finally to physics/sciences, demonstrating a journey from
   learning methods to application in various fields.

2. **Expand on Music and Reading**: Given the detailed descriptions in other
   sections, the music and reading sections could be expanded to include why you
   are drawn to these interests or what they bring to your life. This will
   maintain consistency in depth across all interests.

3. **Personal Anecdotes**: Where possible, include brief personal stories or
   experiences related to each interest. This approach adds a unique and engaging
   element to your profile.

4. **Reflective Tone**: Maintain a reflective and conversational tone throughout.
   This aligns with the overall personal theme of your website and makes your
   content more relatable to the reader.

5. **Consistent Formatting**: Ensure that the formatting (like bullet points,
   emojis, and links) is consistent throughout the section for a polished look.

6. **Concluding Statement**: Consider adding a brief concluding statement that
   ties all your interests together, reflecting how they shape your identity or
   influence your professional work.

By implementing these suggestions, you'll enhance the narrative quality and
personal touch of your "About" section, making it more engaging and reflective of
your personality.
