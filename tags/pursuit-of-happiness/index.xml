      <description>In 5th grade, one of my classmates fell down and broke his arm during a game of two-hand touch football, so the elementary school banned the sport during recess. I was pretty upset about this. Lots of kids were. This was Texas, after all, and we loved our football.
I experimented with other recess activities: hopscotch, double Dutch, chalk drawing, tetherball, basketball, dodgeball, kickball. Many of these activities just didn&amp;rsquo;t do it for me.</description>
