      <description>I just finished undergrad at Columbia University a few days ago. We had a virtual ceremony, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to watch it. I over-exhausted myself this past semester and no longer have the energy left to celebrate. With that said, now&amp;rsquo;s as good a time as any to address some of my big picture ambitions.
Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed an effective system for accomplishing long-term goals such as learning a language, mastering a musical instrument, transitioning fields to a new discipline, and integrating exercise into one&amp;rsquo;s life as a regular habit.</description>
