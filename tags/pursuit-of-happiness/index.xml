      <description>[Amazon link] to support the author Lately, something&amp;rsquo;s got me in a phase where I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in reading books about making art—like Art &amp;amp; Fear and Keep Going. I believe I first heard about Kleon&amp;rsquo;s writing from Ali Abdaal.
Keep Going sticks to Kleon&amp;rsquo;s classic, pocket-sized, lighthearted but heavy-hitting style. It&amp;rsquo;s a quick read, so I went through it a few times. With books like this, I like to make one pass through to jot down quotes and notes on passages that resonate with me and then wrestle with the ideas for a while before coming back to the text.</description>
